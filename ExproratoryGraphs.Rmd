##Why do we use graphs in data analysis?
- to understand data properties
- to find patterns in data
- to suggest modeling strategies
- to "debug" analyses
- to communicate results


##Characteristics of the exploratory graphs
- They are made quickly
- In large numbers
- The goal is personal understanding
- Axes/legends are generally cleaned up
- Colors and sizes are primarily used for infromation

#Useful
- Can plot a rug under a histogram with ```rug(df)```
- Change breaks with ```breaks=``` parameter
- Place avergage on a boxplot with ```abline(h=12)``` and ```lvw``` paramter 

```{r}

```
