Principles of Analytic Graphics
1. Show comparisons
- Evidence is always relative
- Compared to what?
2. Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systemic structure
- what is the causative reason for thinkin about this question
3. Show the multivariate data
- multivariate = >2 vars
- the real world is multivar
- need to escape flatland
4. Integrate the principals that you have
- Completely integrate words, numbers and diagrams
- Data graphics should make use of many models of data presentation
- Don't let the tool drive the analysis
5. Descrive and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.
- a data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible
6. Content is King
- if you do not have good data, no mater how good a presentatino, the whole thing will suck
